                           my name is malachi and i am a rising junior at binghamton university! i was born and raised
                           in new york city (brooklyn, to be exact) and it's honestly my favorite place in the world!
                           i actually have a bunch of goals that i hope to accomplish in the future, many from varying fields,
                           so i hope that amidst my engineering career, i am able to pursue careers on the side! for instance,
                           i would love to be a social media influencer, graphic designer or even a film director! another fact about me? i love music! 
                           my favorite band is the 1975, and my favorite artist right now is harry styles. i've actually 
                           been a big fan of both since i was thirteen and was supposed to see them
                           this year until the pandemic started :(

                        my hobbies include thrifting (i'm very into sustainability), traveling, going to the beach, shopping,
                        listening to music and filming youtube videos! i actually have a youtube channel that could be
                        found <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp8Eay8DqjQq3J0p0J3jwOw">here.</a></strong>
                        though it's very new, i definitely want to film videos about fashion, lifestyle and productivity! i'm also extremely
                        into art, marketing and film as i said before, and i have been using video and photo editing softwares since i was younger.
                        i love all of my hobbies and i hope that one day i'll be able to use them in order to make the world a better place!!
